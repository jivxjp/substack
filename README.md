# substack

This repo captures the writing process for posts on jivx.substack.com through drafts and LLM-enhanced editing.

The author creates a draft under `posts` with a directory corresponding to the date the draft was created. Once the draft is finished, it runs them a LLM using the prompt in `prompt.md`.

Additional the draft is used to generate sutras or quotes throughout the posts using the `sutras.md` prompt.
