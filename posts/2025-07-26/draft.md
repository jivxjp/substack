so how did i made the decision to live in japan?

it's an interesting story and i'd be honored to share with you.

let's go back a few months and i had planned to visit japan during my asia trip. i stayed in japan for about 2 months and i loved it there. during the first few weeks i had considered living there. at one point, i even downloaded the pimsleur language course for it to start learning japanese.

but after chatting with a few friends who lived there and them black-pilling me a bit on japan i had second thoughts and quickly tossed out the idea that japan is a long term thing for me. i enjoyed touring around the country nevertheless thinking that it would be one of my last times here.

after finishing japan, i flew to taiwan for about 2 weeks. during the first few days, i felt like i was getting japan withdrawal. there were many things i missed from japan like the konbini stores, toilets everywhere, and all the convenient train options to go around.

while in taipei, i noticed a strange phenomenon, in a lot of the tourist places i visited, somehow i would be surrounded by japanese. it wasn't just a one time thing either. in one instance when i was in the taipei 101 tower, there was a group of 4 japanese men in front of me going up the elevator. then coincidentally they were again in front of me when we were going down the tower. the strangest part was the day after i saw two of them sitting on the old street in another city called JiouFan that was almost two hours away from taipei.

most people would mistaken me for japanese. when i was traveling the southeast asia the first common guess would be that i'm japanese. it was no different in taiwan. when i started to speak chinese to them, a few of them would be surprised that i speak chinese that well thinking that i was japanese.

it's interesting each person would justify their guess by a different feature of my face. some would say, it was my hair (i have medium-long hair). some would say, it was my beard (i had shaved my beard in japan). most would just it was just my face in general. i asked chatgpt about this and it suggested that it was just my vibe that exudes japanese.

i've always been fascinated by japan's culture and everything surrounding it but never had i considered living there. so it was in this backdrop did the idea "should i move to japan?" tuned into my mind.

i went to a daoist temple called xingtian. i noticed there were quite a few people throwing these two crescent-moon shaped red blocks around. i wondered what that was and luckily there was a digital display nearby explaining the whole thing.

it's divination and process goes like this. one sets an intention or question (yes or no) and pray for an answer from the divine. then one grabs those two divination blocks and cast them on the ground. if both blocks has the concave side facing up, it means no. if both blocks has the flat side facing up, it means no answer or silent or the gods smile. then one is suppose to draw a stick with a number on it and then go back to the divination blocks again to see if that number is the correct one picked. one is to repeat the process until the right number is picked.

since that question was on my mind i set that as my intention and casted the blocks. surprisingly, i got yes on my first toss. i went to draw a stick from a bucket. it was #75. i went back to the divination blocks and casted it again. again, surprisingly, it was yes.

i went inside the building to pick the fortune paper corresponds with the number. it had chinese writings as well as japanese writings on the back. i have no idea what it says since i don't read chinese nor japanese so i asked one of the monks that worked there for his insights.

he gave me somewhat of a positive-neutral answer as to my question. it was only later on did i realize i could use take a photo and let chatgpt explain it to me.

fortune poem (top part):

生前より結び得たり 好き好きの縁因なれば
笑ひて相逢うこともあらう 情けに惚れず相親しむ
当の人物高下無し 意を得れば論ずること休かれ

translation:

the bond was tied before this life — a connection formed in a past existence.
because this is a karmic tie born of mutual fondness,
you will meet with smiles, naturally and without effort.
do not fall in love with emotion, but be friendly and open-hearted.
high or low, status doesn’t matter. if your intention is clear, there’s nothing more to debate.

fortune explanation (middle/lower part):

無理に強く求めなくても良い縁があるから、
相手と自分の立場や状況を比べてみて、
特別に気後れする必要はありません。
一度会っただけで人を判断しないこと。
成功や財産を議論することはやめましょう。
婚姻運は良好、交際運も吉。
欲を出さずに、心のままに得られるものを受け取りましょう。

translation:

there is a good connection waiting—no need to force it.
compare your situation calmly with the other’s,
but don’t feel inferior.
don’t judge people based on a single meeting.
avoid arguing over success or wealth.
romantic and social fortune are favorable.
don’t be greedy—receive what comes from the heart.
```

tdlr:

yes, move.
the path to japan is not born from striving but from destiny already woven. you are being nudged—not pushed. when you go, don’t posture. don’t compare. just go as yourself. trust that what is for you will meet you with a smile. success and companionship will follow if you walk with sincerity, not hunger.

a few days later i visited another daoist temple. this time it was on the hills near Maokong. i asked the same question but this time divination blocks told me that the gods smile. thinking it was just an off chance, i wanted to a redo. i went inside the main hall area where the carpet was completely red and meditated there for a while. after meditation, i casted the divination blocks again. same thing happened once again. i had to laugh as it suggests that we've already given you the answer so why bother us with this again.

later on, i visited the first temple again and this time i went down the underground fortune telling walkway area outside of the temple. i picked a stall based on a number i was drawn to and went inside. i asked the guy for a relationship fortune telling. he gave me a BaZi (chinese astrology) reading. even he thought i was japanese when i first approached him. anyways, according to him for the next three years i would have a great chance to find my suitable mate and japan would be a great place to be at. i told him that i did have a thing for japanese girls. he proceeded to tell me quite a bit of things about me that most people wouldn't have known about me through the reading.

taiwan was my last stop in the asia trip. i flew back to los angeles afterwards and rented a car for 30 days to drive around the area as well as go to spiritual renewal week at Ananda village in Nevada City. it's kind of like a meditation retreat as i tell people.

as i slowly made my way up to Sacremento area, i was just getting readjusted back in the US and also fighting on three fronts: a cough, jet lag and post-vacation blues.

i had finally made it to Ananda village and i felt great by then. i had already been telling a few people about the idea of moving to japan but i was still unsure then.

on the first day of the spiritual renewal week, in the morning i prayed to God for an answer. I asked God "please give me some signs on whether i should move to japan". The Universe delivered three signs rather quickly that day.

first, it was reading an email from a weekly newsletter i receive but i just haven't had the time to read yet. i read it early that morning and there was a subsection talking about something in japanese. in all of my time subscribed to that newsletter, i had never seen the author mention japan once before this. my mind raced to find an excuse and came up with "ok but that email was from a day ago so that doesn't count."

second, after we had finished our morning meditation and we were having breakfast outside. i overheard two people having a conversation at the table behind me talking about something japanese. again, the mind tried to deflect it with "ok that's nice but maybe a bigger sign please."

before i mention the third, i want to share a beautiful experience my heard had experienced. it was the first day of the spiritual renewal week, Jyotish and Devi were the first speakers for the day on the day's dharma talk. before every talk, there is a song sang by the choir. the choir sung a song called "Walk Like a Man". maybe it was the environment but when they sang the lyrics "go on alone..." i began tearing up. something about the vibration of the song and the energy of the place touched my heart in a place where i felt japan is the road that i would need to go on alone and leave everyone behind in a way. i realized what was happening and i tried to hold back but at the same time i realize it's perfectly alright to let it out like this. it was just my heart's natural expression. i needn't suppress it.

after the talks, when i was heading outside, i saw pranaba who was a minister that came to Dallas a few times for a few retreats. i went up to greet him. he asked me where i am these days i told him still in Austin. he said something about someone had told him that i was moving. i was almost shocked to hear this. i asked him who told him that and when. he said he was at Dallas like April and he had heard from someone there. he said that he heard i was moving to japan. later did i learn that someone at Dallas misunderstood and miscommunicated this thinking that i was moving to japan when i was just visiting. but that in itself was a sign i thought.

those were enough signs for me. at that point, i had basically decided that i was moving to japan. i told a few people about my decision and they were happy for me.

prior to that i had already started to think about what kind of business i would start in japan since i was going for the business manager visa route. the idea that came to me was when i chatted with friends in japan and how they told me the frustration they had to deal with while settling into living there. i thought this would be a great open-source project to have a completely free guide on how to do this from scratch. then there is the paid premium service of providing a concierge service to those who want more hand-holding type of approach. i would be essentially the first client of this business. the real treat is building a community behind it for foreigners as i know it's rather hard to integrate fully into the japanese society and make friends there.

since i've been holding the domain jivx.com i thought this would be a great name for this business. i tried to use preying mantis as part of the logo as it has been showing up in my life for some reason recently but chatgpt couldn't quite capture it the way i had in my mind.

then i thought about the 𝕏 in x.com which gave me the idea to look for more of those type of characters. this became 𝕁𝕀𝕍𝕏. and to add a bit of synchronicity spice to it, i added a stroke of a calligraphy brush with a upward tilt at the end to symbolize the upward energy movement. i had an interesting synchronistic story with my encounter with calligraphy that had me copying the heart sutra in Fo Guang Shan temple with a calligraphy set and the next day somehow stumbling into a building that displayed calligraphy art with the artist same last name as mine. i had already been considering taken up calligraphy as part of my meditation practice and needless to say i purchased a brush made out of wolf's fur and bamboo there and brought it back home. i felt like Harry Potter picking a wand as if it chose me.

during the final days at the spiritual renewal week, my friends and i did a few randonautica adventures. it all started when Matt and I were talking about how the japanese love Random Number Generator (RNG). i told Matt that there were RNG elements everywhere from the capsule toys to even the items you can buy in konbini stores. he told me about this app called randonautica. it lets you set a radius on a map and then it will generate a random point using quantum random number generator within the radius. you go to that point, find and interpret the signs from the universe to the question and intention you seek to ask in the beginning. i was thoroughly intrigued by this as he told me his own adventures from using it.

one day, we were just getting back from getting some gas for the car. we saw our friend steven walking in the village so we picked him up and we parked and chilled near the market area. we told him about this app and we were all curious about it and this would be the perfect place to do it since it has high vibration and the village is huge.

steven had the question "are we being guided and protected". we all set that as our intention and hit start on the app. it generated a point for us and we drove the car there. it turned out to be outside the village and into someone's private property. coincidentally, the gate was open on the property so we went in. steven was a bit hesitant about all of it but we all went in. the first thing we noticed as this dilapidated camper top that was on a cleaningly manicured dirt ground. the first thing steven noticed was the name "highlander" on the top right of it. that was meaningful to him since he was from scotland. also by that camper there was a sign posted on the tree about surveillance and also there was a tire next to a kid's tricycle. steven had a great experience during meditation about that sign that took him back to his childhood.

when we got back to the village, they wanted to do another one and this time was for me. since i had already told them i had made up my mind to move to japan, they wanted to do that question again on randonautica. i thought sure why not as it's all in good fun. we sat in the car and started the app again.

this time it did point us somewhere in the village. it took us to a community of houses and into someone's backyard. by backyard i mean a huge meadow area. there was a gate loosely held by some chain. we untied the chain and went in. the field was covered with meadow yellow grass. we slowly made our way around to where the app had placed the dot. as we got closer, we noticed these three rocks that didn't seem like they were there naturally. two of the rocks looked like they were cleaved with a giant knife. those rocks were literally where the dot was on the app. we all noticed that the grounds around looked like it had been cleaned by gophers or some other animals. i walked around to the back and i did see some gopher holes. as i was about to climb on to the rocks, matt, who is a write and a poet, yelled "GOPHERS". steven and i thought the gophers were coming out to grab my foot or something. he yelled out again. we still didn't get what he was trying to imply. he then slowly enounciate to "GO FOR" it. that was when we all got it. we all just burst out laughing and continued to do so as we made our way back to our car. it was an awesome fun experience and a nice confirmation from the universe.

later on, after steven had went back home, matt and i did a final one for him. the app literally pin pointed on the yuba river. there was no way we could even get there so we didn't even try. matt took that as his sign about to flow with life as it's something he wants to work on. we did another one just in case. this time it took us to inside the village but it was some parts where it was owned by some other property owners. we drove down the small tiny road and eventually came to a dead end where there was a fenced gate. we can see from the outside there was a large pipe inside dripping water which we both assumed came from the yuba river. matt took it as another sign that he should just flow more. from those two signs, he committed to follow that principle and offered to stay an extra week to house-sit and dog-sit for our friends whom we were hosting us. there was no way he would've known what life had in stored for him to go through a transformational experience...

these posts serve more for me as a way to solidify my own learning through my own journey to moving to japan. they say the best way to learn is to teach. i remember when i was a coding bootcamp one of the thing they had us to do was to do a weekly blog post about what you had learned that way. i thought it was a nice way to recall and encapsulate and distill down what i had learned that week. it was quite helpful for me just to write down what i had in my mind.

the format of it is going to be for me to write an initial draft and then my chatgpt will polish it as if it's a legit editor. everything will be open-source so you can actually read the draft if you would like. even the prompt i put into the AI will be published.

this is what i have currently have in mind for these posts but i would imagine it's gonna be different as i move through this journey.

thanks for reading
