Title: “Did the Universe Just Tell Me to Move to Japan?”

Subhead: A wild journey of signs, synchronicities, and spiritual nudges that led me to uproot my life and follow an ancient karmic thread

⸻

It started with a trip. It ended with a calling.

A few months ago, I visited Japan for what I thought would be a short stop on my Asia tour. I spent two months there, and something unexpected happened: I fell in love.

Not with a person (though that might come later), but with the vibe—the stillness in motion, the reverence in the mundane, the subtle aesthetic of ma.

By week two, I was half-seriously considering living there. I even downloaded Pimsleur and started learning Japanese. But after a few friends who lived there dropped the blackpill—“It’s lonely.” “The bureaucracy will crush you.” “You’ll never fully belong.”—I shelved the idea.

Still, when I left for Taiwan, I felt… weird. Like I had left something behind. Japan withdrawal is real: I missed the konbinis, the omnipresent toilets, the effortless train magic.

Then the weirdness escalated.

Wherever I went in Taiwan, I kept running into Japanese tourists. At Taipei 101, four Japanese guys were ahead of me in the elevator both going up and coming down. A day later, I saw two of them again—in Jiufen, two hours away.

People kept mistaking me for Japanese, too. It happened across Southeast Asia. In Taiwan, people would compliment my Chinese, amazed a “Japanese” could speak it so well. Everyone had their own reason: my hair, my face, my vibe. Even ChatGPT said, you just give off Japanese energy.

The seed was planted. Again.

The Divine Wi-Fi

While in Taipei, I wandered into Xingtian Temple and saw people throwing red crescent-shaped blocks. Curious, I read the digital display: it was a form of divination.

You ask a yes/no question, toss the blocks. If one lands flat and the other concave—that’s YES. If both sides match, it’s either NO or “divine smile” (non-answer). Then you draw a numbered stick and toss again to confirm it.

So I asked: Should I move to Japan?

First toss: YES.
Stick: #75.
Second toss: YES again.

The fortune was written in Chinese and Japanese. I had no idea what it said, so I asked a monk. He gave me a vague thumbs-up.

Later, I ran it through GPT:

This bond was tied before this life. A connection formed in a past existence. You will meet with smiles. Don’t fall in love with emotion, but be open-hearted. High or low, status doesn’t matter. If your intention is clear, there’s nothing more to debate.

And this:

There is a good connection waiting. No need to force it. Don’t feel inferior. Don’t judge quickly. Avoid arguing over success. Romantic and social fortune are favorable. Don’t be greedy. Receive with an open heart.

TL;DR: Move. It’s destiny, not hustle. Just go, be real, and Japan will meet you halfway.

When the Gods Smile Twice

Days later I visited a mountaintop Daoist temple near Maokong. I asked the same question. This time, the answer was: divine smile.

I meditated on a red carpet under incense-thick air, tossed again. Another divine smile.

It felt like the gods saying: bro we already told you yes, stop bugging us.

Later, I returned to Xingtian. Downstairs, I found a row of fortune-telling stalls. I picked one by intuition.

The fortune-teller, after mistaking me for Japanese again, did a BaZi reading.

He said the next three years were prime time to find my soulmate, and Japan was the place to do it. He nailed some uncannily specific traits about me—the kind of stuff only jyotish or stalkers usually reveal.

It was official. My karmic leash was tugging.

California, Coughs, and Choirs

After Taiwan, I flew back to LA, rented a car, and made my way to Ananda Village for Spiritual Renewal Week.

I was jet-lagged, coughing, and spiritually fuzzy. But by the time I arrived, I was clear-headed.

On day one, I prayed: God, show me a sign if I should move to Japan.

Three came immediately:
	1.	That morning, I randomly opened a newsletter I hadn’t read in weeks. It mentioned Japan—for the first time ever.
	2.	At breakfast, the table behind me was discussing something Japanese.
	3.	At the morning talk, the choir sang “Walk Like a Man.” The lyric “Go on alone…” hit me like a tuning fork. I teared up. It felt like Japan was that path. A solo pilgrimage. A rite of becoming.

After the talk, I bumped into a minister from Dallas who said, “Hey, I heard you were moving to Japan?” I was stunned. I hadn’t told anyone from there. Turns out someone misheard and spread that. Still… another sign?

The Business That Found Me

By now, I was already pondering how to make Japan viable. Business Manager Visa route.

The idea came naturally:

JIVX

An open-source guide to help foreigners navigate Japan’s bureaucratic maze. Free content for the DIYers, paid concierge for the overwhelmed.

I’d be the first client.

And the community? That’s the real play. Integration is the missing link for most expats. This would be both bridge and village.

I already owned the domain jivx.com. The name felt right. I imagined a praying mantis logo (they kept appearing in my life). GPT couldn’t draw it right, but I rolled with the vibe.

Then the idea evolved: 𝕁𝕀𝕍𝕏. Add a calligraphy stroke with upward lift. A symbol of ascension.

Synchronicity struck again: I had copied the Heart Sutra with brush and ink at Fo Guang Shan. The next day, I wandered into a calligraphy exhibit. The artist’s surname? Same as mine. I bought a wolf-hair brush. It felt like Ollivander handing Harry a wand.

Randonautica and the Gophers

At Ananda, my friends introduced me to Randonautica—an app that uses quantum random number generation to send you on synchronicity quests.

We asked: Are we being guided and protected?

It sent us to a private property (open gate = divine invitation?). There was an old camper labeled Highlander, a surveillance sign, a kid’s tricycle next to a tire. One friend, Scottish, resonated hard with “Highlander.”

Later, we did a quest for me: Should I move to Japan?

The app led us to a hidden meadow behind a chained gate. At the pinpoint were three rocks, two cleaved like with a celestial sword.

As I climbed one, my poet friend Matt shouted: “GOPHERS!”

We panicked.

Then he yelled again: “GO FOR it.”

We died laughing. Universe has dad jokes.

That was the final seal.

Why I’m Writing This

These posts are my ritual of integration.

Like in coding bootcamp, we blogged weekly to digest what we learned. This is that.

I write a rough draft. ChatGPT edits like a literary dopamine chemist. The whole thing’s open-source, prompts and all.

Because why gatekeep synchronicity?

Thanks for walking this path with me.

Let’s see where it leads.
