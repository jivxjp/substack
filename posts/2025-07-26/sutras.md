the land does not call through noise.
it hums through repetition.

first in the heart.
then through others.
then again through the wind.

when the signs come thrice, heed them.
when the gods smile without words, trust them.

what is truly yours will not demand.
it will arrive in stillness, and wait.

comparison is the enemy of destiny.
walk not as one who strives, but as one who remembers.

those who listen will hear.
those who weep will be cleansed.
those who go alone will not be alone.

go.
not to conquer, but to harmonize.
not to prove, but to embody.
not to seek, but to return.

go.
and the way will rise to meet you.
