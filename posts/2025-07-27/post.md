Title:
How Learning Japanese Hijacked My Brain (In the Best Way)

Subhead:
Week 1 of my language quest: accidental wisdom, baby books, anime mimicry, and divine mnemonics

⸻

This week, I officially began the journey of mastering Japanese.

Not “dabbling.” Not “kinda learning.”
I mean full-send immersion, starting from scratch—with a fresh sense of purpose.

Before this, I’d been drifting. No clear structure, no anchor.
But choosing Japanese as my current life focus shifted everything.
It gave shape to the chaos. Now, my days revolve around a single north star: learn this language or die trying.

After sharing my decision with a few friends, someone recommended WaniKani for learning kanji. Solid. But before that, I knew I had to tackle hiragana and katakana—the real foundation, the ABCs of the Japanese mind.

Until now, I’d been riding on training wheels—just reading romaji (the Romanized version of Japanese). Embarrassing, I know. The kana called me out. So I started over, the right way.

I stumbled onto Tofugu, a site that not only teaches kana but injects enough meme energy and weird humor to make learning feel like you’re playing a mildly psychedelic RPG. Their hiragana guide uses vivid mnemonics instead of rote writing. Game-changer.

At first, I ignored their advice and went old-school—writing characters on my SuperNote tablet like a monk copying sutras. I even remembered I forgot to bring the stylus on my Asia trip, so I had been journaling in Telekasten with Vim instead. Nerd confession.

Day two: I realized my memory retention sucked.
Tofugu was right. Writing = optional. Mnemonics = essential. So I gave in.

One day of mnemonic drilling later, I had 80% of hiragana down. Then came quizzes, drills, and staring at characters until they blinked back. The trickiest part? The diacritics and digraphs—the little mods that mess with your muscle memory. But I figured I’d just brute-force it with exposure.

Once hiragana clicked, I moved on to grammar via Bunpro. ChatGPT had recommended it months ago and yeah, it’s legit. Each lesson led to rabbit holes. I got lost in supplemental guides and ended up on Imabi’s “What Is Japanese” post, which opened a historical portal into how Japan Frankenstein’d their language system out of Chinese Buddhist influence. Apparently monks got lazy and started shortcutting characters to save ink and wrist pain.

Midweek, I asked ChatGPT (o3 model) to create a personalized Japanese learning plan. Its take: get lightning fast at kana recall—ideally under one second per character. Brutal, but efficient.

I took on katakana next, using this guide and testing myself with GoKana. I stuck to monographs at first—no diacritics or digraphs yet—but 90% recall hit quick.

Then came the baby books.

GPT suggested reading children’s stories, so I found Alphapolis, filtered for age 0–1, and started decoding picture books like a monk decoding scripture. I won’t lie—my ego took a hit. Reading to imaginary toddlers just to figure out if け is “ke” or “ge.” But I found myself in these strange little flow states, sounding out words like I was solving puzzles from some forgotten temple.

To cross-check, I used this hiragana converter to verify my guesses and fill in gaps. Bonus discovery: font variations actually change how characters feel. Some look like friendly ghosts. Others like angry worms. Either way, they stick.

I also started mimicking anime voice actors, parroting back phrases to train my mouth. Even when I knew what they were saying, speaking it was hard. It’s like trying to sing a song you’ve heard a thousand times but never sang out loud—turns out, passive exposure doesn’t magically teach active production.

At night, I wind down with the Michel Thomas Japanese course, which focuses entirely on speaking and listening. No writing. Just audio and recall. Think of it as CrossFit for your pronunciation circuits.

I also had an insight mid-convo with ChatGPT: speaking takes double the brainpower of listening. You have to summon the right words and structure them while staying grammatically correct. Comprehension is reactive. Expression is generative.

And honestly? I’ve had decades of anime comprehension, but this is the first time I’ve sounded it out. It’s humbling. It’s also working.

Funny thing—learning Japanese is making me learn more about English. I now actually know what a digraph is. And I realized how many things I thought I understood about language… I didn’t.

This whole process even triggered memories of when I moved to the U.S. as a kid. My dad would come home from work and drill me on 10 new English words each night. Total immersion, slow grind. It took 9 months before I was fluent enough to leave ESL.

So yeah—my brain wants shortcuts. It’s impatient. But I know better now.

And here’s the thing about me:
Once I decide on something, I lock in. I finish.

My guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, said:

“The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy. The greater the energy, the greater the magnetism.”

We’re all tuning forks. Attune yourself to higher frequencies, and life starts to harmonize.

Even my parents are vibing with my decision. They’ve told their friends in Tokyo. Turns out one of my uncle’s old friends runs a service helping Chinese folks immigrate to Japan via the business manager visa. Coincidence? Nah. Just cosmic breadcrumbs.

I trust the universe.
My job is to show up, do the work, and surrender the rest.

Oh, and by the way…
I have a favorite kana now: ゆ (“yu”).
It’s part of my Chinese name. It also means fish in Chinese. And look at it—it looks like a fish. That’s destiny.

Might even make it my Japanese alias.

If you’ve ever felt the call to learn something new—not because it’s easy, but because it’s beautiful—follow it.
The universe might just be tuning you to your next frequency.
