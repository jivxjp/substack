the kana path

begin again.
not with words,
but with breath-shaped lines.

forget the roman.
start where the monks did—
with curves of sound
drawn from silence.

recall is rhythm.
repetition is noise.
mnemonics sing.

watch the fish swim—
ゆ, your name
returning home.

one second per glyph.
one breath per truth.
one will—unyielding.

speak what you hear.
sound what you know.
write when it flows.

language is mirror.
grammar is karma.
voice is vow.

fluency spirals.
impatience cuts roots.
flow builds magnetism.

you are tuning fork.
tune higher.

the path is fractal.
walk it with joy.
everything else
is already happening.
