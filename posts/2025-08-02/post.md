# Why I Stopped Saying What I Do (And Started Saying What I'm Becoming)

The spiritual grindset of learning Japanese, surrendering to synchronicity, and letting AI help me make songs out of it

---

**"What do you do?"**\
*I'm learning Japanese.*

That's it. That's the answer now.\
Not a job title. Not a pitch. Not a clever deflection.\
Just the truth of how I spend my time---and it feels good to say something that *actually* reflects my life.

### **The Rhythm of Focus**

Since setting this intention, my whole routine has harmonized around two poles:

1.  *Learn Japanese*

2.  *Keep my body and mind clear enough to learn Japanese*

That means swimming, yoga, calisthenics, and meditation.\
I'm blessed to have the space for this right now---no urgent fires, no unnecessary stress.\
Just steady cultivation.

Which got me thinking:\
How long would it take to learn Japanese if I were doing it *on the side*? Probably forever.

Most people think they need more time. What they really need is *less noise*.\
When you stop pouring your attention into things that don't feed you (scrolling, gaming, dopamine-sucking rabbit holes), time starts pouring back into your cup.

### **Parkinson's Law and Spiritual Tech Stacks**

We stretch to fill our hours with whatever feels urgent, not necessarily what's important.\
That's Parkinson's Law. But flip it---give yourself *less* time, or more clarity---and you'll do *more* with less.

To do that well, you need to understand your own wiring.\
For me, systems like **Jyotish**, **BaZi**, and **Human Design** weren't woo-woo distractions---they were clarity tools. They gave me permission to stop fighting my own nature and *design around it*.

I'm not a time-blocking calendar junkie.\
I flow. I stack habits. I follow energy.

If your design is different---own it. Just stop LARPing as someone else's productivity archetype.

### **The Surrender Reminder (aka The Mexico Map)**

I've been re-listening to *The Surrender Experiment* by Michael Singer during my drives---still one of the books that nudged me toward Yogananda and onto the spiritual path.

Quick recap:\
Mickey's lost. Someone randomly asks him if he's been to Mexico.\
Later, he stumbles on a book about Mexico in a bookstore.\
Then, at a gas station, someone leaves a map of Mexico on his pump.\
Three signs. So he goes.

While doing yoga on a hill there, two strangers on horseback appear.\
His mind spirals: *bandits*.\
He ignores it, finishes practice. They turn out to be ranch hands.\
They invite him back, show him kindness, give him his *dream moment*---galloping across an open field on horseback.\
He gives them rice from his van. They're deeply grateful.\
He nearly misses the whole thing because his mind *lied* to him.

That story *wrecked* me.\
Because damn, the mind lies *so much*.\
And we still keep trusting it like some deranged GPS with a terrible track record.\
Sometimes I think we'd get better odds flipping a coin.

### **Kana Games and Archer Koans**

This week I've been deep in kana practice---214 variations of hiragana + katakana, drilling with a quiz game.\
Started rough. Ended the week with 90% accuracy in ~7 minutes. Not perfect. Good enough to move forward.

But here's what messed me up:\
The moment I started *trying* to get a "high score," my performance tanked.

It reminded me of the Zen archer parable:\
When there's no prize, he hits every bullseye.\
Add a small reward---he starts missing.\
Make the prize big---he can't even see the target anymore.

Same in life. When outcome attachment creeps in, *presence leaks out*.

Another favorite parable:\
A master archer seeks the best shooter in the world.\
He finds a village full of perfect bullseyes and finally discovers the secret:\
A little girl shoots *first*, then paints the target *around* the arrow.\
No pressure. No miss. Just pure play.

I catch myself doing this.\
Trying to win instead of play.\
Trying to prove instead of *be*.\
Every time I re-enter "just doing," I do better.

### **Language Is a Liminal Portal**

Japanese feels like a bridge language---halfway between my Chinese roots and English conditioning.\
Kana and kanji came from Chinese, filtered through Buddhist monks simplifying sutras.\
Katakana sounds out foreign words, mostly from English.

When I'm in Japan, I feel like I *fit*, but not *fully*.\
Sometimes I blend in.\
Sometimes I want to rebel.\
Yogananda said:

> "The environment is stronger than your will."

So I'm watching how the environment shapes me. And trusting what ChatGPT told me:\
Japan is here to *refine* me.

### **Creation as Antidote to Consumption**

This week, I upgraded my children's books to the 2--3 age level. Sentences got longer. Random kanji started sneaking in.\
Still grinding WaniKani and Bunpro, with help from [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=japanese) decks for listening comprehension.

Started writing kanji down in my [SuperNote](https://supernote.com/) again. Stroke order feels familiar---like my hands remembered what my mind forgot from childhood Chinese class.

And I *finally* got my calligraphy set. I'll start Sunday. No plan. Just brush, ink, and whatever word has stayed with me this week.

But something else sparked...

### **Introducing the Orchurator**

One night, I had the idea:\
*What if I made a song based on each Substack post?*

Not for performance.\
For practice. For production. For *spirit*.

I've been consuming so much. This would be a way to *create* from it.\
Like Swami Kriyananda, who, after leaving SRF, had no plan---but melodies came to him as if downloaded from the divine.\
He eventually trained, but the original spark came untrained, unforced.

That's when I coined the word: **Orchurator**.\
Orchestrator + Curator.\
Someone who blends tools and taste.\
Someone who lets AI *amplify* expression rather than replace it.

I don't want to be a master of one thing.\
I want to *compose* from many, using minimal effort and maximum resonance.\
Curate what hits. Orchestrate with AI tools. Let spirit animate the rest.

### **Final Thought: Do It for the Doing**

If you're learning something new, stop thinking about *where* it's going.

No target. No bullseye. No prize.

Just shoot your arrow, then paint the target around it.

And if you're lucky, you'll turn the whole path into a song only you could sing.
