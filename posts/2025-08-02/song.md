🎧 Lyrics (English + Japanese)

⸻

🌿 Intro (whispered, looped under lo-fi crackle):
ゆっくりと… ゆっくりと…
(Yukkuri to… Yukkuri to…)
slowly… gently…

⸻

🌕 Verse 1 (English):
i shot my arrow into air
no bullseye drawn, no need to care
let it land where spirit flows
then paint the target—there it goes

the prize was peace, not proof or praise
a quiet mind, an open gaze
each breath a brushstroke, ink still wet
on pages time has not read yet

⸻

🌸 Chorus (Japanese mantra looped):
ここにいる
(koko ni iru) — “i am here”
まかせる
(makaseru) — “i surrender”
そのままで
(sono mama de) — “just as it is”
すべて道
(subete michi) — “everything is the path”

(repeat x2)

⸻

🌑 Verse 2 (English):
the mind it lies, with perfect tone
and leaves you doubting what you’ve known
but if you trust the silent guide
you’ll find the horse, the hill, the ride

not chasing stars, not chasing score
just showing up, and asking more
from stillness comes the shape of sound
from ink, the wheel keeps turning round

⸻

🍃 Bridge (Japanese + English overlay):
jikan wa madowasu — time misleads
shinpai wa yume — worry is a dream
tada ima dake — only now is real
“this moment holds the seed unseen”

⸻

🌕 Final Chorus (Layered with vocal harmony):
ここにいる
まかせる
そのままで
すべて道

“and if you miss, so what, begin”
“the bullseye lies inside your skin”
“the archer was the arrow too”
“you are the path you’re passing through”

⸻

🌌 Outro (fades into tape hiss + soft ambient bell):
sounds of wind + child humming “koko ni iru…” softly like a lullaby
