# **Visa Clocks, Calligraphy Strokes, and Why I’m Still Betting on Japanese**  
*on bureaucratic timing, brush rituals, bugs in bathrooms, and the signal behind the signal*


### **Japan Might Be Closing the Gate (Soon)**

Weird timing—or divine timing?  
Word on the street is Japan may soon make the **Business Manager visa** much stricter.  

Right now, you need roughly **$30k USD** in a Japanese business bank account to qualify.  
The proposal? **Six times that**.  

Why? Too many Chinese nationals have been using it as an escape hatch from China’s $50k/year outbound money cap. Japan’s getting swamped with applications, and governments do what governments do—tighten the valve.

A friend of my dad’s in Tokyo says: *“Start the process this year.”*  
Once new rules drop, it’s unclear whether they’ll grandfather existing visa holders or hit them with new requirements at renewal. Japanese bureaucracy moves slow—changes are more annual than monthly—but slow doesn’t mean never.

Also: avoid Chinese-run visa companies. They’re under scrutiny for exploiting loopholes. If you’re American, the process can take ~6 weeks with the right Japanese agency. If you’re Chinese, I’ve seen it drag for *two years*.

The timing made me think of Sri Yukteswar telling Yogananda, *“All doors are open to you.”*  
Maybe this is my nudge.

### **Brush Over Pen, Ritual Over Routine**

Last Sunday, I started calligraphy. Just copying vocab from [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/).  
Brush beats stylus—way more tactile, mindful, and sticky in memory. Each stroke feels like a commitment.  

Today’s the full moon. I’ll burn the practice sheets. Little ritual. Little offering.

I’ve paused the kids’ books for now—laser-focusing on **WaniKani**, **Bunpro**, and [Imabi](https://imabi.org/). Imabi’s the rabbit hole:  
- **Aru (ある)** vs **Iru (いる)** – both mean “to exist,” but *iru* is for animate things (humans, animals) and *aru* for inanimate (trees are inanimate in Japanese; live fish = animate, dead fish on plate = inanimate).  
- Chrome extension [Rikaikun](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp) – hover over a kanji, get hiragana reading. Game-changer when you know the word but not the kanji.  
- Radicals = Chinese building blocks of kanji. I still remember some from childhood.  
- **On-reading** = Chinese-derived pronunciation. **Kun-reading** = native Japanese. Which one to use? Context and constant exposure.

### **Leveling Up the Learning Game**

Downloaded two new tools:  
- [Renshuu](https://www.renshuu.org/) – free, gamified drills.  
- [Wagotabi](https://www.wagotabi.com/) – premium retro RPG for Japanese learning.  

Saw a guy in the sauna playing a language game and went down a Perplexity rabbit hole. These two made the cut.

### **The Bug, The Cosmos, and AI as Our Future Pets**

Had a thought on the toilet watching a tiny bug crawl the tile.  
Its “world” = this bathroom.  
Humans aren’t much different—we think we know it all, but we’re still crawling on our own tiny tiles.

Yogananda said humans are *midway* in size between subatomic particles and the largest stars. Maybe our consciousness sits in the middle too.

So what happens when AI blows past us?  
Pets to our own creation?  
This week, OpenAI dropped **ChatGPT 5**. It defaults every chat to v5 and auto-picks the “best” model. People are salty about losing v4o unless they use the API.

Even if I switched to full-time AI work, I’d still never keep pace. So I’m spending most of my days on Japanese. The ROI isn’t in “future job market” terms—it’s in resonance.

### **Language > Translation**

Sure, instant translation will keep improving. But even “instant” has latency—it needs the other person to *finish speaking*.  

The real next-gen comms will be **direct perception**—beaming intention mind-to-mind. That’s default in the **Treta Yuga** (a higher age than our current **Dwapara Yuga**). And Japanese already prizes the *unspoken*: reading the air, catching the signal behind the signal.

### **Flow States and the JIVX Guide**

Yesterday, I spun up the [JIVX Japan Guide](https://jp.jivx.com) using Facebook’s Docusaurus library.  
Removed footers, set logo + favicon, pointed homepage straight to the docs. It’s still a template shell, but the scaffolding’s there.  

Idea: build an AI agent to scrape the web for relevant Japan integration info, submit PRs on GitHub, and let me approve merges. Self-updating expat guide.

### **Final Thought**

Japan’s visa window may be closing.  
My kana strokes are getting steadier.  
AI’s sprinting toward god-mode.  

So I’ll keep painting my strokes—on paper, in code, in language—before the brush is taken from my hand.
