doors tighten,
paths clarify.

move while thresholds are low.
choose clean hands.

ink slows mind.
ash seals vows.

names stack like strata—
ON above, KUN beneath.

a tree is ある,
a dog is いる,
a fish decides by breath.

beetle on tile,
human in cosmos—
same posture, nicer floor.

ai runs ahead.
walk your art anyway.

speech is latency,
presence is instant.

build the guide.
guard the merge.

when the doors open, go.
when the fire cools, bow.
