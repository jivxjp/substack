(chorus)

くるま　とまる
こころ　ひらく
まえへ　すすむ
ただ　あるく

ゆめ　の　なかで
しずか　な　みち
ひかり　を　ふむ
ただ　あるく

mirror moves slow, but the mind moves fast
a wheel goes flat, so the path can last
tread wears thin where the silence sings
the road gives way to subtler things

entropy whispers in bolts and gears
attachment costs more than it first appears
owning is renting, renting is chain
freedom walks light through sun and rain

no thing is mine, but all is gift
the pendulum swings, the soul must lift
drop the weight, let stillness steer
the middle way is always near

(chorus)

くるま　とまる
こころ　ひらく
まえへ　すすむ
ただ　あるく

ゆめ　の　なかで
しずか　な　みち
ひかり　を　ふむ
ただ　あるく

time is a mirror that answers late
don’t chase the echo—initiate
plant the thought, but hold it loose
intention’s power lies in letting it choose

language is code, kanji is key
risk the sun to truly see
what once was “paranoia” grows
into a world that only bestows

walk, talk, meditate, breathe
on the path where illusions leave
carry the soul, not just the pack
onsen dreams bring stillness back
