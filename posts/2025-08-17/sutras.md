tire, mirror, kanji, path

clunking tire.
forced stillness.
a lesson in wear.

entropy speaks:
everything breaks.
few things last.
even fewer are worth owning.

release the grasp.
let what must fall, fall.

transurfing whispers:
intention forms reflection.
desire distorts.
doubt delays.

the mirror lags.
faith holds the image.

pendulums swing.
stillness frees.
walk your line.

yogananda warns:
environment bends the will.
so choose your field.
plant where light gathers.

kanji emerge.
primitives remembered.
meaning before sound.

mouth, sun, eye—
risk made visible.
language is geometry.

wanikani bows out.
heisig steps in.
mnemonics meet muscle.

write to remember.
stroke to integrate.
form calls spirit.

pronoia blooms:
the world conspires for you.
belief carves reality.

pilgrimage arrives.
88 temples.
10 days.
1 dharma.

walk. talk. meditate.
soak. sleep. transform.

not a tour.
a rite.
a rhythm.

domains align.
routes imagined.
books to bind.
souls to host.

between cultures,
you stand.
a bridge.
a beacon.

when reality feels unreal,
walk with others.
sweat with them.
laugh.
break bread.

this is real.
this is now.
and you’re ready.
