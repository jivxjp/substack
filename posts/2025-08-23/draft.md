it's always hard in the beginning to start something. there is that state where there is no energy and you are generating it from scratch - from 0 to 1.

that takes a tremendous amount of energy and in the beginning that energy is weak and easy to dissipate. it's only by continually building up that initial energy does a swirl take place. eventually that swirl becomes a spiral which is one of the most powerful and elegantly designed form in the entire universe. it's the golden ratio. it's the perfect mathmatical beauty. once it passes a certain threshold, a tipping point, the energy seems to have a will of its own.

you can see it in nature like a hurricane, a whirlpool, a tornado, and even our galaxy itself. all of them are forces of nature so powerful we are in awe of their power. and they all started with that initial gathering of energy. most of the time the condition or timing just isn't conducive to continue further yet there are those few times where everything just seem to gather momentum and the energy continues its own way and eventually generate into something like that powerful force.

we can observe that in our life too. when we start anything new there is that initial excitement where tons of enthusiasm and energy serve as the catalyst to jolt it into manifesting it in the physical realm. but eventually that energy dissipates unless we put in the continual sets of energy into it. that's where the real work begins. and the energy we put isn't in a linear fashion either - it's on an exponential curve because the energy itself is doing some of that work as well.

the human mind has a terrible grasp of exponential curve. our minds can really only grasp in a linear way.

i always like to pose this question to people to give them a taste of exponential growth. let's say hypothetically there is a paper that keep folding infinitely. each fold means it's doubling. how many folds do you think it will take for the height of the paper to reach the moon from where we are standing?

most people would guess in the thousands or tens of thousands when the correct answer is 42 folds. that usually blows their minds and their minds just cannot accept that. and a bonus fyi - it takes 108 folds to get to the edge of the universe.

this is why exponential growth is so hard to grasp and even einstein said compounding is the 8th wonder of the world. he is also known to be credited with the rule of 72 which warren buffett and other investors like to use. you take the number 72 and divide it by the interest rate or growth rate and you will roughly get the number of years it takes to double.

there is another story or legend of a guy that invented chess back in the days and he showed it to the king. the king enjoyed the game so much that he wanted to give a reward to him. the peasant only asked for a grain of rice that doubles for each square on the board. the king didn't understand exponential growth so he thought this was a humble request so he granted it. well it turned out there was 64 squares on the board so effective doubling 64 times and the final tally was over 18 quintillion grains of rice which would effectively bankrupt the entire kingdom.

speaking of spirals, i had a nice conversation with a friend and i brought up the fact i feel like our life is just a circle within circles. by that i mean we go somewhere and we return eventually completing a circle but that's just within a bigger circle. for me, there is a nice feeling of traveling somewhere and then returning back to it years down the road. there is that sense of remembrance, of returning back and completing that circle which is just within other bigger circles. and that could even extend beyond this life or incarnation.

he extended this metaphor by adding that everything is just a spiral which i thought is true. what is a circle but a two dimensional representation of a spiral. so in a way we are moving in a new direction but sometimes there is that overlap when viewed from above that looks like a completion of a circle when in the third dimension we are elsewhere.

i had another realization in a morning where i swam. i was swimming laps indoor as the outdoor pool was closed. there was another dude swimming in the lane next to me. when i was just catching my breath at the end of the lane, he was doing endless laps. when he did his flip to return, the splash from the water hit my face and there was a big generation of waves that hit my body eventually moving it as i just floated there. my mind was thinking thoughts at the time and for some reason, the idea came to me - what if our thoughts are like the waves?

those are not "my" thoughts - those are just thoughts. my mind was tuned into a frequency and able to attune to those thoughts and i'm just aware of those thoughts. it was just like that dude who generated the waves and hitting my body. those thoughts are hitting me in a passive way as i float in the cosmic sea. and those thoughts are exhibiting wave patterns because i was not fully aware of them - they are just passive. it's only when my consciousness being focused on any particular thought do they catch my attention and in a sense become a particle or a point.

this made me think about the double-slit experiment where thomas young did an experiment on photons. he noticed that a photon exhibits a wave pattern by itself without anyone observing it but once an intelligent observer starts to observe it then it becomes a particle. later on it was tested on electrons too which has the same properties. what are photons and electrons but just energy?

we, the consciousness, give thoughts a form from a wave to a particle. from that we power it further with the energy, will, within us to manifest it the physical realm. everything starts with a thought.

i feel like that's when the ocean is just a powerful metaphor used in spiritual teachings. in raja yoga, there is the gunas of a wave. it's the property of the wave. the part closest to the ocean is the sattwa, the middle is rajo and the crest is the tamo. the sattwa tendencies are the calm and peaceful aspect that's closest to the Source, that is the ocean. the rajo is the activating aspect of the wave which relates to the ego where we get our energy. and from that pull of the energy becomes the darkening aspect of what we do with our ego in the tamo where we take our importance generated from the ego a bit too high for our own good.

there is a beautiful metaphor of samadhi which means bliss or merging with God, the Source. we are all just individual droplets of water and our purpose is to merge with the ocean where we came from. that's the real meaning of yoga - merger. the merge of atman (soul) with para-atman (Supreme Soul).

but when a drop goes into the ocean, there bounds to be a bounce where another drop flies up above the ocean. that's the salbikalpa samadhi where the ego is still there. and until we get to nirbikalpa samadhi we are not safe from ego's temptations. that's when there is no bounce from the droplet and the final merger happens.

i love the water metaphor as there is so many variations of the water form itself. there is ice, liquid, vapor, bubble - they're all just forms of water itself.

during one of the nights before my meditation for some reason i pulled up the notes i took when i had a jyotish reading with a wise vedic astrologer almost two years ago exactly. i had almost completely forgotten about it and i was shocked to see how accurate it was in the events that had transpired in my life.

he said that my challenging time had started may 24th, 2024 for about 10 months. this was the exact period where i felt burnt out at work as i questioned the meaning of it all. there were whirlwinds of emotions and thoughts that came to me where it made just shutdown at work. somehow it seemed life was telling me to quit and arranged it in a synchronous way for me to get out.

one of the first thing he said that i have a bumpy ride ahead for 3 and a half years onward and it will completely change how i am currently. that i'm heading into a closing of a 19 years cycle and a 17 beautiful years ahead.

i have a strong aquarian nature which i had to look it up and it described me to a tee. i like to gather knowledge and i try to practice nishkam karma which is detached action.

i'm here for moksha, liberation - and i'm heading there. the best thing for me is how to best serve people. i'm encouraged to start a spiritual community.

from just rereading this, i'm very curious to see where life is taking me. in a sense, i feel like all of it has already happened and i'm just here to witness the result. the intention had already been planted in the metaphysical realm and the physical realm is just catching up with it through time.

this week i also went back to rewatch the matrix again for the 30+ times. i didn't watch the whole thing. i only skipped the scene that pulled me. one was the scene where neo met the kid in the waiting room in the oracle's place. that kid was bending spoon with his mind. neo tried to do that and the kid gave me some wise advice. "do not try to bend the spoon. that is impossible. but only try to realize the truth - there is no spoon. then you will see that it is not the spoon that is bending but only yourself."

neo tried that and it worked. from the transurfing book, it talked about two infinite mirrors facing each other and just reflecting each other with nothing but emptiness. that does conjure some kind of imagination in the mind with a picture. it's true though. we are just reflecting in the mirror what we project into it. there is no spoon in the sense that there is nothing out there besides what we project out. when we bend, the reality bends with us as its the reflection in the mirror.

then neo meets the oracle. he didn't believe in fate so oracle went along with his logic and played it out for him.

i feel this is like the jyotish reading on why and when we were born at this time at this place kind of thing. there is a reason for that and we actually chose the womb to be born in because we need to grow in this certain way.

it reminds of me the oracle telling neo not worry about the vase and then he bumped it and cracked it on the floor. he apologized and the oracle said what's really going to bake your noodle is if she hadn't said anything would he had broken it?

it's like that with the reading, if we knew what was going to play out the future would that change the trajectory of the future or is it like a self-fulfilling prophecy. maybe getting the reading was part of the future.

it could also be the attractor state or morphic field just has a really high probability of happening and there is no escape from that. that in a sense is one's karma. one can't escape one's karma because of the built up in the attractor state that this is going to happen. with a help of a guru, one might mitigate or lessen it but it will still happen.

like in the autobiography of a yogi, there is recount of a story of babaji struck one of his disciple on his shoulder with a burning log. lahiri mahasaya, another disciple, was shocked. he asked for the reason? babaji replied would you rather see him burn in a fiery death? a karma must be satisfied and by doing this lesser act of the fire log, he had helped him cross over that karmic debt. then he proceed to heal his burnt shoulder.

in the second matrix film, neo now has the ability to see in the future via his dreams. when he met the oracle again, they talked about the concept of free will and fate. the oracle said he didn't come here to make a choice, the choice has already been made. he's here to understand why he had made that choice.

this is very interesting because it goes in the concept of time. time is an illusion. humans can only perceive time in a dimension or one slice of it at a time yet time has already happened, happening, and will happen. the concept of knower, knowing, known as one when one reaches samadhi.

so in a sense, everything has already happened and we are just perceiving the present moment one slice at a time in order to understand why we had made this choice in every moment if we are aware of this. there is a big difference between knowing something and experiencing it in totality.

that's what morpheus told neo after he had rescued morpheus from the military building. there is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. we can know everything about how hot a stove is but until we touch it we then know the true meaning behind not doing that again.

in my japanese learning, i've been amazed at how remarkable my memory was using the technique from remembering the kanji. everyday i'm doing one lesson at a time with about 20 characters or so. before learning the new ones, i got back and review and recall each the characters i had learned from before. i've been able to recall over 95% of them which is pretty amazing to me. all in all, i've learned about over 100 kanji so far. after every lesson, i also write the kanji in my supernote as a way of memorizing by the strokes as well. there is something satisfying to me about writing the kanji.

some of this week's kanji that stood out to me i felt whoever created these were lol'ing when they did.

刀 means sword which kind of looks like the handle of a sword where you hold it. when you add a 口 mouth kanji to it, it becomes 召 which means to seduce. in a way the creator thinks the mouth can be used as a weapon to attack which is akin to seducing or manipulating someone or attacking someone's mind.

then you add on the 日 sun kanji and it becomes 昭 which means shining. it's like seducing the sun in order for it to be shining on you.

another one for lol is 妬 which means jealous. it is a combination of two kanji 女 (woman) and 石 (stone or rock). i think you can guess why it was created this way.

in other fronts, i'm still doing the wanikani lessons as well as the bunpro. the bunpro one is interesting because it's teaching me more about the grammar than the vocabuary. i dread doing the reviews because i'm not good yet with recall the grammatical structure of a sentence using the connectors or markers, the past tenses with conjigation, the past negative tenses along with the polite and standard versions of each. i was doing them slowly them but i felt like i had a breakthrough this week. somehow i'm able to do this way more easily than before. i don't know the reason why i felt like i'm more connected with the language from just constant exposure through various means. i'm just trusting this process as i'm observing myself through that.

something else i've been doing is doing the anki cards. this is strictly for listening comprehension. someone had a compiled a list of common phrases through cutting out clips from anime or shows. i feel like i'm rather good at understanding most of them because i kind of grew up watching anime so a lot of phrases i've just become accustomed to. i also try to practice saying them out loud by imitating the voice actors.

another thing i started doing is reading the [tadoku graded reader](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/19bitqy/2024_updated_free_tadoku_graded_reader_pdfs_2681/). i'm starting at the level 0 ones. it's interesting because they're easy enough for me to read and there is contextual learning properties as well because it goes through a list of life scenarios with illustrations along with furigana (hiragana on top of kanji) for students to learn through reading and looking at the context to understand.

occasionally when i have some spare time i would play the wagotabi game. it's also contextual learning through rpg context. like pokemon style game where you collect learning or words and challenge others through them.

i noticed something this week through my workout as well. i've been doing deadlifts on wednesdays and it seems like this tires out my body enough that i need some extra time to recover that night for sleep. on weekdays, i get up at 5am every morning and on thursdays this week, when i got up to do meditation there was this fog where i'm half asleep or i felt the body and the mind was craving for some sleep. i knew i can power through that but at the same time why do that to the body. so i went back to sleep and naturally woke up at 9am. i missed my swimming that day. this made me ponder to switch the routine to have deadlifts on friday instead because i can sleep to later on a saturday. it was an arbitrary schedule anyways so i can be flexible in listening to what my body needs.
