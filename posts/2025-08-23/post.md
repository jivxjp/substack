# **From Spirals to Spoons: What This Week Taught Me About Energy, Karma, and Kanji**  
*On exponential growth, bending reality, and tuning into the deeper current beneath thought*

---

### **The Zero-to-One Problem**

Starting anything new feels brutal.  
There’s no momentum, no current, no pull—just raw willpower dragging reality from **zero to one**.  

That early energy is fragile. Easy to dissipate.  
But when you keep feeding it—day after day—the energy swirls, then spirals, and eventually crosses a threshold where the thing starts *moving you*.  

The spiral is nature’s blueprint: hurricanes, whirlpools, galaxies, even DNA.  
One initial push, amplified into self-sustaining force.  

This week, I kept seeing spirals everywhere—in learning, karma, and even my own thoughts.

### **Exponential Curves, Not Straight Lines**

The human brain is terrible at intuiting exponential growth.  
Ask people:  

> “If you folded a sheet of paper infinitely, doubling its thickness each time, how many folds to reach the moon?”  

Most guess thousands. The answer: **42 folds**.  
To the edge of the observable universe? **108 folds**.  

This is why Einstein called compounding “the eighth wonder of the world.”  
Same lesson, different legend:  

The inventor of chess asked the king for “one grain of rice doubled on each of the board’s 64 squares.”  
By square 64, the kingdom’s grain stores are bankrupt—over **18 quintillion grains owed**.  

Growth looks invisible… until it isn’t.

### **Circles Within Spirals**

A friend and I talked about how life feels like circles nested inside larger circles:  
We return to old places, people, patterns—but at a *different level*.  

Viewed two-dimensionally, it looks like a closed loop.  
Zoom out, and it’s a spiral—each “return” actually an ascent.  
Revisiting, but never the same.  
Incarnations included.

### **The Wave Behind the Thought**

One morning, swimming laps indoors, a guy in the next lane flipped-turns, sending waves rippling into my body.  
I wasn’t swimming—just floating—and it hit me:  

What if **thoughts are waves**?  

They arise from somewhere beyond “me,” pass through awareness, and most drift unnoticed.  
But the moment consciousness locks onto one, it *collapses*—from wave into particle.

That’s literally physics: in the **double-slit experiment**, photons act as waves until observed; once measured, they crystallize into particles.  

Consciousness chooses the form.  
We are *not* our thoughts.  
We tune into them, like stations.  
And what we energize, we make real.

### **Yoga, Gunas, and the Ocean We Came From**

Raja Yoga compares the mind to waves:  
- **Sattwa** – calmness, closest to Source  
- **Rajo** – activation, ego-driven striving  
- **Tamo** – turbulence, attachment, heaviness  

The goal isn’t to stop waves—it’s to merge with the **ocean** itself.  
*Samadhi* is that merger: the drop dissolving back into its Source.  

But even in bliss, ego lingers.  
In **sabikalpa samadhi**, there’s still a “bounce”—a subtle sense of “I experienced this.”  
True liberation is **nirbikalpa samadhi**: no bounce, no separation, only One.

### **When Jyotish Aligns with The Matrix**

I revisited notes from a **Jyotish reading** two years ago—forgotten until now.  
The timing, eerily precise:  
- **May 24, 2024** began a 10-month period of burnout + endings  
- Leads into closing a **19-year karmic cycle**  
- Followed by **17 expansive years**  
- Purpose: **moksha** through **service**—building spiritual community

The physical seems to be catching up with intentions planted long ago.  

This reminded me of *The Matrix*.  
There’s a scene where the Oracle tells Neo:  

> “Don’t try to bend the spoon. That’s impossible.  
> Only realize the truth… **there is no spoon.**  
> Then you’ll see it’s not the spoon that bends—it’s you.”

Transurfing says the same thing: reality mirrors our projections.  
When we bend, the reflection bends.

### **Fate, Free Will, and Karma Management**

In *Matrix Reloaded*, the Oracle tells Neo:  
> “You didn’t come here to make the choice.  
> You’ve already made it.  
> You’re here to understand **why**.”  

Jyotish agrees: time is layered, not linear.  
Choices exist—but within karmic attractor states, like gravity wells.  
You can’t “skip” karma—but a guru can help **lessen the blow**.

Paramhansa Yogananda recounts a story of Babaji striking a disciple with a burning log.  
Lahiri Mahasaya, shocked, asked why.  
Babaji replied:  

> “Would you rather he die in a fiery accident?
> Better a burn now than his whole karma unresolved.”  

The log healed quickly.
The lesson stuck.

### **Learning Japanese: Memory, Mnemonics, and Mischievous Kanji**

This week marked a breakthrough:  
- Using **Heisig’s _Remembering the Kanji_**
- Learning ~20 characters/day
- Reviewing with about **95% recall rate** (100+ kanji learned so far)

Heisig’s genius = **primitives** + story-based mnemonics.  
Example:  
- **刀** = sword  
- Add **口** (mouth) → **召** = seduce (*a weaponized mouth*)  
- Add **日** (sun) → **昭** = shining (*seducing the sun for its rays*)  

Some kanji creators were definitely trolling:  
- **妬** (*jealousy*) = 女 (woman) + 石 (stone)… interpret freely.  

Meanwhile, Bunpro drills grammar; WaniKani covers vocab; Anki decks train listening comprehension using anime audio clips.  
Bit by bit, **context + exposure + flow** is rewiring my brain.

### **Designing Around Energy, Not Forcing It**

One thing I noticed:
Wednesday deadlifts wrecked my Thursday meditations.
Woke foggy, craving sleep, fighting my own body.

Solution: moved deadlifts to Fridays—let Saturday mornings handle recovery.
Tiny shift, huge payoff.
Lesson: **listen to energy, not the calendar.**

### **Final Thought: Walking the Spiral**

We think we’re learning kanji, building projects, bending spoons, folding papers.  
But beneath all of it, we’re just moving along a spiral:  
starting again, returning higher, tuning deeper.

The wave carries us, but awareness chooses where to land.  
And maybe everything—karma, kanji, and cosmos—already unfolded.  
We’re just here, riding the reflection, learning why we chose it.
