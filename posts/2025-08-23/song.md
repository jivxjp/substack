[english verse i — emergence]
from zero to one, the silence stirs
a whisper moves, the circle whirs
the smallest spark, the hidden seam
becomes the spiral, becomes the dream

folding the paper, edge to sky
forty-two steps, the moon floats by
108, the veil undone
galaxies born from a single one

[japanese refrain i — mantra, slow & soft]
いま　うまれる
ひかり　の　うず
しずか　に　まわる
こころ　の　はじまり

[english verse ii — flow & return]
circles within, returning home
each step ahead, yet wider roam
waves collide, the thought arrives
nothing we hold is ever mine

particle born from conscious sight
wave dissolves back into night
drop to ocean, self released
form to formless, merging peace

[japanese refrain ii — mantra, rising]
なみ　の　なかで
しずむ　こころ
ひとつ　になる
かみ　と　わたし

[english bridge — choice & mirror]
the mirror bends when we do too
the path we walk already knew
past and future fold as one
in timeless breath, we’re always begun

[final japanese refrain — mantra, fading]
ただ　あるく
ひかり　ふむ
こころ　ひらく
ただ　あるく
