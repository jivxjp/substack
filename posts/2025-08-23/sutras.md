# spiral sutra

beginning is fire.
fragile. fleeting.
tend it.

swirl becomes spiral.
spiral becomes force.
force becomes form.

nature whispers ratios:
galaxy, hurricane, whirlpool, seed—
all one geometry.

exponential hides in plain sight.
paper folds to the moon.
time folds to the infinite.

circles within circles,
ascending unseen.
returning, yet beyond.

thoughts arrive as waves.
none are yours.
awareness chooses,
particle condenses.

consciousness shapes.
will charges.
reality follows.

drops rise and fall.
ego bounces.
ocean waits.

time bends.
choices echo.
we walk what’s already walked.

kanji speak in strokes:
刀 sword, 口 mouth, 召 seduce, 昭 shine.
女 woman, 石 stone—jealousy’s glyph.

language is pattern,
pattern is memory,
memory is prayer.

trust the spiral.
trust the tide.
fold by fold,
step by step,
you merge.
