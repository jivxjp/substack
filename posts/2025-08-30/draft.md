a lot of ideas of how the pilgrimage can be run comes to me throughout the week.

i would jot those ideas down and sometimes i would consult with chatgpt to flesh it out further.

before i would just jot them down on zettlekasten using vim, but yesterday i actually created a board on trello and created cards for each category of things to do. i feel things like this moves the energy further and just like water can be stale without flowing, the energy of something can also become stale if we don't do something to further that through actions.

going back to the jyotish reading from 2 years old, i asked the vedic astrologer whether is it in my dharma to start a business. his answer surprised me. he said that based on my chart, my calling is not really business. career > business for me.

he continued that it's a fallacy to think only business can make a lot of money and don't do business for money but instead do things for others.

it occurred to me that maybe i could ask chatgpt about the origin of the word career. it turned out the word career originally means a path or course for carriages. then it evolved to mean a race track before eventually becoming a path for one's work which is what is commonly known now.

i thought what a perfect origin meaning for the pilgrimage. what is a pilgrimage but a sacred path to be walked on. and the sacred economics just ties it all in to make it not be a business but a path for each individual and their own offering for this.

i feel like the disney's motto of "we make films to make more films" resonates with this: "we do pilgrimages to do more pilgrimages".

i feel like there is also the example of the vippasana retreats where each individual donates whatever they're willing to. it's a way for the next group to participate. this is the same motto this pilgrimage service aspires to as well. so i feel like at the end of the pilgrimage, there could be a way for each pilgrim to offer something for the next group whether be money, work, or anything they feel that can add values for the next group. it's their way of serving.

i've been reading this book called the game of life and how to play it. there is lots of spiritual teachings that are in line with what all the great teachers talk about. i got the book recommendation from a random recommendation from a youtube channel. i downloaded it right away.

the recent chapter i read had a beautiful way of describing thoughts as objects from a metaphysicist. he said the only thing that has weight is from the effect of gravity. that boulder that seems so heavy on the ground is just being pulled by the gravitational pull of the planet. if the boulder was lifted above pass a certain point then there is no weight.

we can relate this to our thoughts as well. the only reason we feel burdens is because we have thoughts stuck in the subconscious mind and thereby it seems so heavy. if we were to lift our thoughts up to the superconscious then it would have no weight at all. at that point it's up to the divine to solve our problems and we become light. that's what jesus was talking about when he said my burden is light as he absolutely operated from the superconscious at all times.

there is even a prayer in the book that we should repeat often even for a few hours until we truly believe it to the depth of penetrating to the subconscious mind. i like it.

there was an affirmation that i liked from the book:

>"i do wonderful work in a wonderful way; i give wonderful service for wonderful pay".

i thought it rhymed very nicely and can be used in any circumstances. it's way to channel one's energy in a creative way.

there was a chapter about asking for guidance on one's highest duty, i did that during meditation one night as well as this morning. i asked for what's my highest due service fitting for me as well as asking if the pilgrimage service is it.

when i was doing my kanji learning that morning, there was a word 柏 which means oak and the way to remember it was the famous myth of the golden bough. i had to look it up what that was. apparently it's a legend of diana the huntress outside of rome and people still make pilgrimages there for blessings. i thought that was interesting. a little nudge there.

before i went to the gym, i thought to do a randonautica adventure with the same intention i had for meditation. it took me to a neighborhood. the pin was inside the house so i just parked there and checked out the area. the only thing that caught my attention was the license plate of the car in the driveway which ended with 1776. i know the number because of the declaration of independence.

later i asked chatgpt about it, it told me it's about radical sovereignty. that i'm building a third space - a sovereign zone of seekers walking home.

energetically it symbolizes breaking from the imposed systems and creating a new paradigm rather than following the old forms and the number points me toward liberating the model of pilgrimage itself, not locking into the capitalist framing. this is what the sacred economics is about.

and finally that afternoon i saw a forum post from ananda online from someone that i had met at the village during spiritual renewal week. she has the same last name as me. she posted a thread on she is going back to china to do a pilgrimage with a few people very soon. she even sent pictures of all the sites she was going to visit. i wished her a nice time for the pilgrimage. at the same time i feel like those were enough confirmations for me.

i still plan to work on jivx but more just jotting down stuff that i think would useful for individuals who want to move to japan. in fact, one of the thing i did this week was to clean up the old templated content and actually put a few initial structures on there. now it's been update at jp.jivx.com

this is now more a side project instead of my main focus which is going to be the pilgrimage service. i already have tons of ideas on how to do it as well as marketing behind it creating different content that i think would be cool. in a way, i'm just rehashing things from previous work as well as mix and matching different things i've seen in the past.

i thought about how many people in the world can actually do this. i feel like i'm in a unique position to be really probably one of the only ones to bring this new concept to life. i thought about what steve job said in [a rare interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw) when he said about the world we live in is only a construct made up by people who are no smarter than you. once you realize you can play or interact with that reality and can make a difference in it, that's when magic happens.

i feel like that is my dharma. i asked chatgpt about the sacred economics model and what cycle of yuga does it belong to. it responded with satya yuga which is the highest age that has over 4,000 years in that age. i feel like there is something magical about bringing forth a higher age ideal into a lower age and operate from that level.

yogananda talked multiple times about world brotherhood communities. he said that's the way of human beings living in the satya yuga in smaller communities. i totally believe it because we have the dunbar number which theorize that once a group of people gets above 150 people, then they lose that intimate connection because of the n of n relationships becomes too much. the idea size of a community is around that number.

this is also the reason for a smaller group in the pilgrimage because once it gets too big it becomes harder to build that intimate connection. ideally i feel 12 is a good number to go for. i know when i did my ayahuasca retreats, both of the times the total number was 15 which was still a good group. before we did the first ceremony we did activities that built bonds between each individuals. in a way it builds harmonious energy in the group.

i told this to the friend who actually introduced me to the sacred economics book by charles eisenstein. he said something profound: when we start to tie our time, which is sacred, to a monetary value, we actually turning something sacred into a commodity making it profane.

>As my life is given to me by God I am born in the gift. Time is a division of my labor,  my life is sacred gift given freely. When people say your time is valuable. It actually traps you in attachment and desacralizes your life, and removes the gift. The sacred cannot be commodified to apply a fixed unit of value.

something occurred to me when i was walking with my parents one night. we were talking about something and it occurred to me that we will always have incomplete information about each person. from that perspective how can we even give advice to the other person even if that person had asked for one?

since the information we received from them is only a sliver of the whole how can we know the reality behind it all? and that is assuming even the other person even communicated everything to us with nothing to hide from even oneself. sometimes we even deceive ourselves and we are probably the easiest to deceive.

so we are always operating from a tinted glass distorting the real. our mind then tells us what to do and sometimes we follow the mind's advice while other times we don't. then we get the consequences of those actions. sometimes "good" other times "bad". yet we still trust our minds.

can we actually be honest to ourselves in understanding the mind doesn't really know the answer? only be realizing that we can actually start to see the signs from the universe by being observant in reality to see what's trying to happen here?

we'd start praying for answers from the universe and we start to see those answers in front of us through events happening to us. some call it random while others call it synchronicity. we are all connected to that Source whether we believe or not.

something occurred to me again one morning during my swim day to extend the analogy of the wave and thoughts.

when i was in the cold plunge, i realized that when the water is calm i can feel the ice cold water's in a nice way but when someone walks into the tub and creates that ripples with the wave and they hit my body, it disturbs that stillness and when the waves me my body i can feel the icy sensation in a more intense way for some reason like the water had became became colder at least to the mind. i know logically that it's not possible since the water is always at that temperature. so it has something to do with the mind's interpretation of that disturbance. and then as soon as the waves calm down, it's back to that original state.

this can be extended to the thoughts to the mind as well. when we are that state of equanimity and peace, it's like that undisturbed state in that cold plunge. as soon as the waves of thoughts sprung forth we are hit by them and become disturbed by them. the sensation might feel more intense but where we are seated is always the same. it's about letting those waves pass all by itself and letting it settle down all by itself while being comfortable in the meanwhile with that disturbance knowing eventually it will settle back. that's the practice. it can be in meditation or just in little moments during our daily life.

another thing i noticed is once i sit in the cold plunge pass a certain point while doing pranayama breathing, i could feel there is a sensation of coldness coming from my throat area. there is a chakara center there, 5th chakara center to be exact. then i can feel getting a natural high in my head area like feeling lightness. it's a nice sensation. i can see why i could rather keep my body there regardless of the coldness to keep experiencing that sensation.

while i was feeling that sensation, the idea came to me this is what the free divers must've felt like when they go deep into the ocean with one breath. once they pass a certain threshold, they get that natural high in their head where it just feels so good that they want to keep feeling it so they go deeper into the depth of the ocean disregarding the potential danger. this is why there is a 10% fatality rate in this profession.

in a way it's rather poetic because the yogic spiritual teaching has the metaphor of the ocean as the para-atman where the atman or soul merge into. what the free divers are doing is the literal act of it. i wonder if they're conscious at the point of the soul exiting their body at that point.

on that same day i pinged the friend who sent me the company he used to establish his company and getting a busines manager visa. i sent him an article about [an osmotic power plant in fukouka](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-osmotic-power-plant-fukuoka-saltwater-electricity-renewable-energy-13928026.html) that turns saltwater into electricity. he asked me what was my plan to move to japan. i told him q1 next year. he asked where i am at with the processs. i told him i haven't started but will next month. he suggested that i should start right away. i put that on my weekly to-do list.

then later that night, my dad told me my uncle's friend said that the japanese government is already thinking of passing that new requirement and is even making it stricter by needing a full time employee that has a master's degree. he suggested that i should do it immediately.

those were enough signs for me. i immediately contacted the agency that sets up businesses in japan that my friend had recommended to me. at first i used their contact form but it wasn't going through. then i emailed them but i thought they might take a while so i just called them with google voice number. we have an initial consultation meeting the next day. it turned out they were pretty fast as they replied to my email when i was on the call with another person.

the meeting went well. mikako was the person and she spoke fluent english. she gave me the lowdown on what's going on right now. she doesn't even know what the government's policy is going forward. it seems like there is rumor that things will change in october but all of it is just rumors. but this does put some unknown into their business as they can't tell their clients what they don't know.

i'd imagine they won't do this until next year so i'm at the last part of the train in a sense. she did say it's quicker if i go to japan and file the paperwork for the visa in person with one of their representative. apparently there is a dedicated office for people applying for startups which puts them in a fast track to get reviewed. it used to be 2 months or so but now she said for the us passport it will take over 3 months.

with the regular way of submitting the paperwork online it will take anywhere from 6 to 12 months to get screened and approved. i feel i should go with the in-person submission as i don't want to delay any further and it seems like the energy is flowing that way.

she gave me all the quotes and procedures so now i just need to start it. this kind of made things real for me in a way whereas before it was more like an imagined thing where this puts it into definite form. that's good as i feel like the stagnant energy dissipates over time. this active energy is moving somewhere and it seems like it has an attraction of its own.

i have completely faith everything will work out as it is because i feel like the universe is inviting me on this quest to japan to do this pilgrimage service for others. how can i doubt what's already planned?

i feel like once the process has started, my mind would imagine all kinds of different scenarios already. i can see it talks about how much hassle it would be to complete all the paperworks as well as all the other chores along with settling into japan. on and on it goes. i'm just watching it.

she did say that the paperwork would be about 80-100 pages. they have experience dealing with the immigration office so they know what to put on the business plan and such. when i asked her if it would be better to say that the business is for tech consulting as i have background and experience in tech versus the retreat and pilgrimage business. she did say the government likes the tech part better albeit she said they did help several people starting retreat businesses as well.

as far as the japanese learning goes, i think i'm doing quite well in terms of picking up things unknowningly like the subconscious doing its work in the background. by doing the consistent bunpro everyday, i starting to get the hang of the grammar and conjugations associated with it. it's slowly but definitely happening.

for example, i think i'm getting the aru/iru and the more polite version of imasu/arimasu. when i was doing the conjugation on bunpro i was just guessing i think without realizing the rule regarding the difference between the imasu and arimasu. i guess it sounds weird with irimasu so they just dropped the り part. i got this why doing the michel michael course on the disc 7. i'm almost done with this course as the last disc is 8. it's very basic but i think it has good fundamentals with it.

of course, i had seen that before when it was first introduced but that usually slips out as soon as it went in. it takes quite a bit of time for the mind to really chew it and digest it properly.

for kanji this week, some of the kanji that stood out to me was:

木 - tree, 林 - two trees turned into a grove, 森 - three trees turned into a forest

沫 - it's a combination of two primatives; water and extremity - meaning splash. the image i had conjurered up is the waves on the ocean the tamo guna which is the crest of the wave where the ego is in delusion the most comes crashing down making a splash

兆 - is a word i didn't even know the english meaning which was portent. portent means an omen or something calamitous is going to happen. how to remember this is picture the kanji like the groves on a turtle's back foretelling the future.

i'm still reading a chapter of tadoku which is helpful as i understand almost all of the meaning based on the context associated with the pictures drawn in the background. of course i'm still on level 0 and there are quite a bit of them - 71 in all.

and occasionally i'm also playing that retro rpg game to help with more japanese learning in a gamified way.
