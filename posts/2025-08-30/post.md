# The Pilgrimage as Career: Notes Toward a Sacred Path

*From Trello cards to divine signs, how my dharma unraveled in kanji strokes, cold plunges, and a license plate.*

---

A lot of ideas for the pilgrimage service come to me throughout the week.

I jot them down. Sometimes I ask ChatGPT to help flesh them out. Before, I used to keep them as raw notes in a Zettelkasten system with Vim. But yesterday, I moved everything into Trello—organized by cards and categories. It felt like **energy moved**.

Because just like water, energy stagnates without flow. Ideas, too, can become stale unless put into motion.

### Is It My Dharma?

Years ago, I asked a Vedic astrologer if it was in my dharma to start a business. His response surprised me:

> “Business? No. But _career_? Yes.”

He emphasized: Don’t confuse making money _with_ starting a business. Money doesn’t only flow from enterprise. It flows from _service_.

This reframed everything.

I looked up the etymology of “career.” It originally referred to the _path of a carriage_. Later, it meant a _racecourse_. Only recently did it evolve into “one’s work path.”

A pilgrimage, then, is quite literally a **career** in the original sense: a sacred path. And the model of **sacred economics** fits perfectly—not as a business, but as a **vehicle** for offering and receiving.

Vipassana retreats offer a template: donations from one cohort fund the next. So too, the vision here is for each pilgrim to offer something forward—money, service, blessings—to the ones coming after.

A true gift economy.

### Superconscious Lightness

I’ve been reading _The Game of Life and How to Play It_. It hit me hard when the author described how thoughts become heavy only when stuck in the subconscious.

> A boulder feels heavy because of gravity. Take it beyond gravity’s pull, and it’s weightless.

So too with thought.

When thoughts remain below the level of conscious awareness, they burden us. But when lifted to the superconscious, they lose their weight. They become light. _We_ become light. This is what Jesus meant when he said: “My burden is light.”

There’s a prayer in the book meant to be repeated for hours, until it pierces the subconscious:

> _“I do wonderful work in a wonderful way; I give wonderful service for wonderful pay.”_

It’s rhythmic. Mantric. Useful in any context.

### Asking for Confirmation

I’ve been asking for signs.

During meditation: “What is my highest service? Is the pilgrimage my true dharma?”

The same morning, I was studying kanji. I came across: **柏** — _oak_. It’s linked to the myth of the Golden Bough, a Roman pilgrimage site dedicated to Diana. Still active today. Felt like a whisper.

Later that day, I ran a Randonautica adventure with the same intention. It dropped me into a random neighborhood. I parked. The only thing that caught my attention was a license plate: **1776**.

That number buzzed. Declaration of Independence.

I asked ChatGPT what it meant. It replied:

> “Radical sovereignty. You’re building a Third Space—a sovereign zone for seekers walking home.”

1776: a symbolic break from imposed systems. A call to **liberate pilgrimage itself** from capitalist scaffolding.

That same afternoon, I saw a forum post from someone I’d met during Spiritual Renewal Week at Ananda. Same last name as mine. She was going on pilgrimage in China. Posted her entire itinerary.

More synchronicity. More nudges.

### Side Projects, Main Quests

JIVX will still move forward—my open-source guide to integrating into Japan. This week, I cleaned up old templates and updated [jp.jivx.com](https://jp.jivx.com/).

But it’s now a **side quest**. The main storyline is pilgrimage.

I already see the content: reels, blog posts, cinematic loops, sacred edits. The concept practically builds itself.

How many people could actually pull this off?

I feel like I’m one of the only ones uniquely positioned to do this. Steve Jobs once said:

> “Everything around you was made by people no smarter than you.”

Realizing that is when the magic starts.

### Operating from Satya Yuga

I asked ChatGPT what yuga sacred economics aligns with.

It answered: **Satya Yuga**—the age of truth.

Yogananda spoke often of world brotherhood communities. Living in harmony. Dunbar’s number confirms it—communities lose cohesion beyond ~150 people.

Pilgrimages should stay small. _Intimate_. Ideally 12. When I did ayahuasca retreats, there were 15 of us. Still bonded deeply.

Sacred space = small scale.

My friend who introduced me to Eisenstein said something profound:

> “When you tie sacred time to money, you commodify it. You profane it.”

We are **born into the gift**. Our time is sacred because our life is. Don’t price the infinite.

### The Mind Knows Nothing

One night, walking with my parents, it hit me:

We never have full information about another person. Not even close. So how can we advise them?

Even if they ask. Even if we try. Even if _they_ believe they’re sharing everything—chances are, they’re not. Most people deceive themselves first.

We look through tinted glass and call it clarity. Then trust the mind to make decisions based on that distortion.

> But the mind doesn’t know.

What if we accepted that? Then we could finally **observe** reality. Watch for synchronicity. Let the universe respond.

Not think.

**Notice.**

### Cold Plunge Dharma

One morning during cold plunge, I noticed something:

When the water is still, I can tolerate the cold easily. But when someone else steps in and sends ripples across my body—it feels colder.

Same temperature. Different _perception_.

Same with thoughts.

When the mind is calm, we’re fine. But when thoughts ripple in, they stir the surface. They amplify sensation.

The practice is staying centered even as waves crash. Let them pass. Let the water still itself.

Pranayama helped. I felt cold radiating from my throat chakra—Vishuddha. Then a wave of euphoria in my head.

That’s when I thought of **free divers**.

They descend on one breath. At a certain depth, a natural high kicks in. They chase it. Sometimes fatally.

There’s poetry there. Yogis describe samadhi as merging with the oceanic para-atman. Free divers enact it literally.

### Japan: The Final Boarding Call

That same day, I pinged a friend who got his visa via a business manager route. Sent him [this article](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-osmotic-power-plant-fukuoka-saltwater-electricity-renewable-energy-13928026.html) about osmotic energy in Fukuoka.

He asked about my timeline. I said Q1 next year.

He said: **start now.**

Then that night, my dad's uncle's friend—who lives in Japan—told him that Japan might soon require new visa applicants to hire a full-time employee _with a master’s degree_. He also suggested I start now.

Enough signals. I acted immediately.

Tried their contact form. It failed.

Emailed them. No reply yet.

So I called with a Google Voice number.

Success.

Had a call with Mikako. Fluent in English. Said they don’t know what the government will do next. Rumors say changes coming in October. Maybe later.

She said: submitting in-person in Japan = faster. Like 3 months instead of 6–12. There’s a dedicated startup office. If I go in person with their rep, I’m on the fast track for the visa.

Energy says: GO.

She sent me the invoice and quote to start establishing the company—**not** the visa paperwork. That part comes later. The idea is to set up the company first, then begin the visa process when the structure’s in place and more is known about potential regulatory changes.

She also noted that while the government prefers "tech" businesses, she’s helped people get approved for **retreat businesses** too.

Time to begin.

### Japanese Study Notes

Japanese study going well. Bunpro is helping me internalize grammar.

Michael Thomas course is simple but foundational. I just finished Disc 7.

Kanji insights this week:

-   **木** = tree, **林** = grove, **森** = forest
    
-   **沫** = water + extremity = _splash_. Tamasic delusion crashing.
    
-   **兆** = portent. Turtle shell divination.
    

Tadoku reading (level 0) is fun and intuitive. 71 stories in all.

And that retro RPG? Surprisingly useful.

**TL;DR:**

I’m walking a path that feels ancient, new, personal, and universal. A career in the oldest sense of the word: the sacred way beneath our feet. Signs point clearly. The pilgrimage calls.

I’m listening.
