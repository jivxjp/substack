[english verse i — the offering begins]
not business, but breath
not profit, but path
a sacred trail, not made but found
where footsteps echo deeper ground

do wonderful work, in wonderful way
the pay is the light that blesses the day
we walk to give, we give to grow
the seed we plant is not our own

[japanese refrain i — mantra, slow pulse]
たび　の　はじまり
こころ　の　みち
ひかり　を　わたす
つぎ　の　ものへ

[english verse ii — sovereignty & surrender]
1776 on a driveway sign
a whisper of freedom, not by design
no system owns this pulse, this flame
we walk unnamed, we walk the same

paper turns sacred when spirit flows
the real wealth is what one bestows
when time’s no longer weighed in gold
we find our soul can’t be bought or sold

[japanese refrain ii — mantra, calm center]
じゆう　の　いし
こころ　の　ねがい
つたえる　ことば
とき　を　こえて

[english bridge — spiral remembering]
ideas arrive like birds in sky
they land, they lift, they don’t ask why
the sacred moves when given shape
each act of service reshapes fate

[japanese refrain iii — mantra, closing loop]
めぐる　みち
つたえる　ひかり
ささげる　たましい
ただ　あるく
