ideas arrive like birds—
some land, some circle,
some nest.

energy, to stay alive,
must move.
stagnation is forgetting.

career means path.
pilgrimage is career.
sacred motion is work.

give forward, not back.
serve the next traveler.
we journey so others may.

the burden is gravity.
lift thoughts to light.
they become weightless.

affirm the spiral:
wonderful work,
wonderful way,
wonderful service,
wonderful pay.

signs are enough.
license plate: 1776
—sovereignty reborn.

kanji whispers:
oak, bough, bow.

the call is loud,
the path is wide,
the number is twelve.

small is sacred.
big forgets.

to monetize time
is to shatter the gift.
sacred cannot be sold.

we know nothing of each other.
only glimpses.
yet we advise.
madness.

synchronicity is the echo
of your own prayer.

waves disturb the stillness.
but stillness never leaves.
just wait.
observe.
return.

the cold reveals the light.
from throat to crown,
ice becomes ascent.

freedivers dive not for air,
but for union.

a call to japan.
paperwork made form.
dream now has spine.

you are on the train.
do not doubt
what you boarded.

watch the mind whisper
its usual protest.
but you are already moving.

language seeps in:
iru, aru.
trees make forests.
turtles foretell storms.

the spiral continues.
so do you.
