since we had to cancel our group meditation last sunday, i felt like i had plenty of time that day. actually probably throughout the week there is time and it's just about how best to spend that time.

time is sacred and priceless and yet worth nothing if we don't use it right.

last sunday, i generated a logo for pilgrimae and it came out great on the first attempt.

i started putting that into all the social media accounts and also changed the name to use the scientific unicode that i used for jivx.

the idea came to me one night: why don't i use black & white style for all the content like youtube videos and shorts, instagram photos.

i thought about using veo3 to generate the shorts based on a short post that i can post on patreon, then generate a script with that for the video along with video cliips generated from veo3.

for the instagram photo, i can use the colored version for the present. the b&w for the past and some kind of different filter for the future.

and then the pilgrimage videos i can just use b&w altogether.

i felt like doing more for pilgrimae this week. maybe it's a spurt of energy kind of thing but ideas come to me all the time and in mind i'm imagining the pilgrimage as well. that's definitely a good sign.

i saw an article about how to identify the impulse actions or emotions we have in an article recommended by recommendo. it was a site called psyche.co and i browsed through the site a bit and lo and behold i came across an article about pilgrimage. i read through that and there were numerous references about japan as a pilgrimage desination. as i read through it, the mind would sometimes say it knows there will be a reference soon about japan and there it was. even near the end, it said one more time and surprisingly there it was one last time mentioning about japan.

i watched the documentary what the bleep! do we know. it was about how much of reality we perceive isn't what we think it is. we actually co-create the reality with the universe. our intention matters as it was reflected by the water experiment by this japanese guy mentioned in the film. the quantum mechanics is super interesting in terms of how it was shown in the film. it also explained about the quantum entanglement which i had heard of the term before but now know exactly what it is.

it is basically that two things are basically one by the entanglement even when we are on the opposite ends of the universe when one thing is effect the effect is felt by the other thing instaneously. and we all came from one so in that sense we are all effected instaneously by another.

one day between studying japanese, i got the background cover for social media done for pilgrimae. it has the same calligraphy style but i had it where there is a red brushstroke somewhere that stands out. it is perfectly positioned above the patreon's profile pic. i had to do some edits for the youtube cover though.

then that night it came to me to use the same hex color for the website background and accent color.

there is something nice about envisioning something in the mind and bring it down to form in the physical realm and now it's more likely to be the digital realm which isn't real per se but now we are living in that realm more so than the physical realm.

i actually did a first instagram post with that idea that came to me. i used a photo i took a decade ago while i was at the temple of the universe with a bridge. that was the colored photo. then i used banana nano to generate two different variations of that photo using different prompts to do it. the past has more a calligraphy black and white style while the future has that energy aura based around everything.

i want to play with veo3 so this week i think i'm going to use google's deep research to do a deep-dive on a pilgrimage route and then have chatgpt to pick one section of it and make a small post on it to patreon. then i'll have it generate a script based on that for a short and then use veo3 to create the clips based on that script and add my voice to it. finally putting it all together using final cut pro. i will have to see how it all plays out.

oh yeah this is all because i got google's pro plan with 2tb of storage now along with the pro version of the gemini and limited access to veo3. i cancelled my icloud plus subscription and just backed up my photos to google photos instead. i still don't like the fact that the hyperscalers have access to most of my life essentially but that's the life we are currently living in.

i know there are ways to be self-sufficient in the digital realm. it takes quite a bit of lifestyle adjust to get there i think.

i had the urge to do the idea about taking a deep research topic about something related to japan pilgrimage which i put into gemini deep research about shikoku. then i took researched topic into a pdf fed into chatgpt to let it pick something that stood out to it. chatgpt picked the staff one takes during the pilgrimage.

i composed a post for patreon. then i had it generate a script for a youtube short as well as the scene that accompanies it so i can generate video clips for each scene using veo3. i found out using the regular gemini page it only allows 3 videos per day. but i found out from reddit that you can use their flow project which allows one to generate quite a bit of videos using veo3. so i did that and it worked fine. the only issue is the videos are widescreen instead of vertical. using the regular gemini way i can prompt it to have it vertical but not so for flow.

after i got all the clips, i stitched them together using final cut pro.

i felt great doing all of that that time just flew by. i saw i had missed a call from a friend so i called him back. we chatted for about 2 hours before i had to grab dinner.

after dinner, i wanted to finish the thing before my meeting with yumi for the company establishment in japan.

i recorded my saying the scene narration on voice memo on my mac. i used a ai voice cleaner to clean out the background echo ambient noise so sounds nicer. i put that into final cut pro as well. my narration was longer than each clip so i had to slow down the video clip in order to match the pace of the narration. it turned out to be perfect as it fit perfect for 1 minute which is the max length for youtube shorts.

finally i used suno to generate some background music for the entire clip. i tried elevenlab's music generator but it just doesn't do a good job. maybe i'm not prompting it right.

finally after i exported the complete video, i put it through withsubtitle website which runs locally an ai model to add subtitles to the video. i always wanted to try using that but never got the chance to before. it came out great i thought. i had to manually edit some parts of the subtitle with the correct spelling but it was minimal. and it only took about 3 minutes to do the video processing.

then i uploaded it to youtube and tiktok. that was it. all in all it took me about 3-4 hours to do the whole thing. i'm sure i can bring that down even further.

i was excited to share this with a few friends.

this is cool because i'm learning something new as well as i'm going through this.

it reminds me of making something for the audience of one in the age of ai and even if that one person is me, it's still very much worth it.

the meeting with yumi went smoothly. she just wanted to confirm some things with me as well as getting the name of the company. i had asked chatgpt to come up with a name and the first one it came up with was 前路 which means the path before. i really resonated with that. the first kanji character is the same as the mae in pilgrimae. i thought it would have the same pronounciation but they actually are called zenro. so instead of mae it's zen. i thought what a perfect match.

it reminded me almost two decades ago, i created another gmail account as a secondary account. a part of it i named it zendo which at that time i wanted it to mean the way of zen. and now i'm getting a total recall for coincidentally naming a japanese company called zenro for a pilgrimage business. what a trip.

yumi had to mention again the potential immigration law that might change which would require change to the company structure as well. we talked about it some more thinking out loud how unreasonable it is to do this so fast. she mentioned that it could all just fall away because there could be too much potential issues with implementing something like that as well as the backlash it would face.

when i was swimming one morning, the story of yogananda trying to pass tests for his ab degree. sri yukteswar assured them that it would be impossible for him to fail them. it would be easier for the sun and the moon to switch places than for him to fail these tests. it means that tis this was written in the stars as one's destiny or fate. i feel like that as God has planned this all out for me already. it would be easier for the sun and the moon to switch than me not doing the pilgrimage service in japan.

oh yeah. another thing yumi mentioned when i told her about my pilgrimage/retreat business idea, she said that i couldn't arrange all the accommodations and transportations for people because that would require me to be a licensed tour operator. afterwards, i consulted with chatgpt to find out it's true and japan has strict laws about that.

it suggested the easiest and best way for me is to partner with an existing tour business that aligns well with my mission and let them take care of everything from transportation to accommodations. that would require me to do some meet and greet to find a company that vibes well with me and what i'm doing.

this is actually a blessing in disguise as my mind was already thinking about how to plan all of this like contacting all the inns and such to do that. but now it seems like i can just outsource all of that stuff to someone else who actually specializes in that. i can focus on what's the most important which is actually the experiential part of it. the logicistics can be outsourced to people who does this professionally. i just need to orchestrate everything together in a beautiful harmony.

i got the certificate of signature document on friday that needs to be signed with a notary to be able to let her to even start letting me sign all the other paperworks.

i went to my bank without making an appointment and it seemed like the notary was out on vacation. the front person asked me to make an appointment at another location until she saw how long i had been a customer of theirs. she said they wanted to take care of me and one of the banker it seemed was a notary too.

she was on the phone so i waited while they had me met another banker to pitch me products or things i might need for my business.

the banker asked me about my business and i told her honestly that i'm going to move to japan and start a pilgrimage service business designing the whole thing. she gave me an advice of carrying my debit card around since i don't carry it with me because for wires above a certain amount the system would require me to enter my debit card information. i took that to mind and went home and entered it into my password manager.

the notary went smoothly but it did take a bit of time and my morning was pretty much gone after i came back home before going to the gym after.

i started doing another post for patreon because i don't want to let the veo3 daily credits go to waste. so i generated another post and started creating videos for it. sometimes the videos wouldn't turn out the way i wanted so i have to redo it which takes another credit. this way i can wait another day to continue without wasting it away unused.

there is part of me that despise wasteful spending like not taking full advantage of something. even though i'm not using 100% of chatgpt and i seem to be fine with that. yet with gemini since there are other things i can use i feel like i want to maximize it.

the idea came to me today while at the gym to do the book (pilgrimage photos along with spiritual teachings) in digital format and post that on patreon which paid subscribers will get it for free. the physical copy can be crowdsourced using kickstarter and make a threshold for the goal to commit. since it's not really a book it doesn't even need to have an isbn. it will be more expensive than a typical book since it will be hard-bound with japanese craftsmanship. it will be made and shipped from japan too. i thought about putting the backers and subscribers names on the last page as a way to thank them.

another idea that came to me was this app idea for ios and android where it will display the pilgrimage routes in details and mark things along the way. this will be completely free and people can signup and join people who want to start their own pilgrimage following the walk, talk, meditate format. it would be cool to have a community like that i feel. it also will have the iternary for people who are on a pilgrimage which is a nice way for them to keep track what's going on.

i also thought about creating a dedicated page for zenro as well which is the exact copy of the content on pilgrimae but just in japanese. then i thought about what i can do to make the social media channels to be both in english and japanese.

i started with instagram. i went back to the first post of the instagram photo and changed the description to contain both english and japanese.

last night drafted what i had envisioned for pilgrimae which will be turned into content for the main website. i had the idea of having that website having a cta button which redirects to [pilgrima.ge](https://pilgrima.ge) which will be the website that has the current/next pilgrimage available. because this is still in the ideation phase, i thought to have a temporary page now which for some reason actually prompted me to build it and so i did.

it's a very simple web page with the cover photo as the background along with a button that redirect to the patreon page for people to signup and get notified when it happens. i wanted to finish that before i went to sleep which i did and felt great when it was finished. i had to do some touch ups this morning to make it complete though.

i also finished a book called getting real by jason and david at 37signals about building software projects. i feel from their simple way of building their products used by millions of small businesses, it could be applied to building experiential product like pilgrimae combined with a digital aspect as well. i took a good deal of things from it. i'll definitely need to revisit it again when actually deep in building the pilgrimage experience.
