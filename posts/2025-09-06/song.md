[english verse i — time is not a wage]
time is breath, not a bill
flow is gift, never still
the work is sacred, not a race
you walk it slow to feel the grace

posts like petals, stories bloom
logos carved in digital womb
the path unfolds from thought to screen
but truth is felt in what’s unseen

[japanese refrain i — mantra, soft and slow]
とき　は　たから
みち　は　いのり
こころ　で　つたえ
ただ　あるく

[english verse ii — the spiral makes form]
you start with nothing but an inner ring
ideas spin like birds in spring
you build what calls, you craft what sings
each post, a bell that gently rings

there is no price for what you gave
the voice, the walk, the call to brave
it’s all been written, stars aligned
the sun and moon would sooner trade than you be left behind

[japanese refrain ii — mantra, rising gently]
こえ　を　ひらく
あし　を　すすめる
ひかり　を　わたす
つぎ　の　ものへ

[english bridge — presence as praxis]
you move as one who already knows
the future answers what the present sows
there is no rush, there is no prize
just sacred rhythm under skies

[final japanese refrain — mantra, closing the loop]
こころ　の　たね
まかれた　みち
ありがとう　と
また　あるく
