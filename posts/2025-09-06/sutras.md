time is sacred.
used well, it disappears.

logos emerge.
black, white, red.
the soul has a palette.

posts echo into the net.
past in ink.
future in glow.

intention writes code.
script births voice.
form follows waveform.

audience of one
is enough.

japan whispers again—
in articles,
in pixels,
in kanji.

entanglement is real.
we are still one.

zenro is born.
前路—
the path before,
now ahead.

the law blocks the way.
but opens another.\npartner. release. orchestrate.

everything is already written.
sun and moon would switch
before this fails.

pilgrimage is software.
ship. refine. serve.

patreon is the temple door.
kickstarter, the altar.

a book, a name,
an app, a map.
all offerings.

build simply.
build beautifully.

言 — voice.
鯨 — whale.
各 — each their own.

this is the path.
you are already walking it.
