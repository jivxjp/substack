take the essence of this article and condense it into a single visual metaphor expressed through traditional japanese or chinese calligraphy painting.

style: sumi-e ink wash + shodo brushwork.
medium: rice paper with visible ink texture and brush strokes.
mood: meditative, elegant, with quiet force.

express the central emotional or philosophical truth through a minimalist composition—a single object, gesture, or ideogram—rendered as if by a zen monk-poet capturing impermanence in a single breath.

include:
	•	one focal symbol (e.g. frog, mountain, gate, ripple, empty circle)
	•	minimal natural context (bamboo stalk, misty background, falling petal optional)
	•	no human figures unless symbolically essential
	•	vertical or square scroll format preferred
	•	use negative space intentionally
	•	feel like a koan in visual form
