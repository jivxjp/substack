i want you to take inspiration from the nature's or God's encoded harmonics/harmony in the creation of everything like the golden ratio that seems to be everywhere in creation from God or humans alike. based on that inspiration can you edit a writing piece from that place of inspiration?

once the piece is edited please make that into a sutra.
